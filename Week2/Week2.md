		Sentiment analysis is used to find underlying opinions on text. In the articles above, it was used to find the opinions
	regarding online sellers. I think that this may be useful for consumers in order to know if an online seller can be 
	trusted or not. Getting reviews from the products that the seller offers or reviews regarding the seller and applying 
	sentiment analysis to it may tell us if the seller can be trusted or not. 



2)	Proposed topic 2: Solving Math Word Problems Using Natural Language Processing

		Computers can solve word problems with the use of natural language processing. The first paper talks about a system that
	can	solve simple word problems with the help of NLP. The second deals with solving four types of word problems (investment, distance, projectile, and percent). I think that NLP can also be used in solving more complex word problems with more
	complex formulas.
